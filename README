CTF_AI_Comp_2012

Author: Johann Jungbauer

Blerb: This repo is for my code for the AISandbox.com/AIGameDev.com Capture the Flag Commander AI competition.

VERSION 0.3 ___
[Dec 9, 2012]
This version has a defender squad.

VERSION 0.2 ___
[Dec 9, 2012]
This version strips out the supporter code. Adds a rush mode that is triggered be all enemies being dead in the respawn window.

VERSION 0.1 ___
[Nov 23, 2012]
This version is pretty much the Balanced AI example with a slight tweak on how the flag carrier moves when the flag is in hand.
